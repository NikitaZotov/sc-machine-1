# Build system

## Implementation details

The project uses CMake as the build system generator. CMake allows for cross-platform builds and provides the necessary flexibility for both project development and its use in external projects.

[Conan](https://conan.io) is integrated as an optional dependency manager via dependency resolver mechanism introduced in CMake 3.24 (see `cmake/conan_provider.cmake`). Conan helps us manage external libraries and allows us to create reproducible developer environment with ease. However, the build system is designed to work without Conan if needed.

## Compilation steps

Typical configurations of the project are provided in the `CMakePresets.json` file â€“ this means that if you use a modern IDE, **no additional configuration is needed**. Just pick one of the configurations provided by this file and use controls in your IDE to recompile and run tests (should work with VSCode + CMake Tools extension, JetBrains CLion and probably many others).

If you wish to use CLI instead, you can list all the available configurations in the `CMakePresets.json` file and pick one of the presets:

```sh
cmake --list-presets
```

For example, this is how to build sc-machine in debug mode using dependencies from Conan:

```sh
# use pipx to install Conan if not already installed
# Install pipx first using this guide: https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/ 
pipx install conan
# Use preset with Conan-provided dependencies and debug build type
cmake --preset debug-conan
# Use debug build preset since we've used a debug configure preset
cmake --build --preset debug
```

This is how you would build sc-machine in release mode using system-provided dependencies:
```sh
# release build type with tests (no conan postfix = system-provided deps)
cmake --preset release-with-tests
cmake --build --preset release
```

The build artifacts will be located in the `build/<Release|Debug>/bin` folder.

Default installation folder location (used for package consumption) is `build/<Release|Debug>/install`, installation process can be fired by appending `--target install` to the `cmake --build --preset <preset>` command.

## Consuming the package

<summary>find_package() using CPack artifacts on GitHub Actions</summary>

The package artifacts are available [here](https://github.com/ostis-ai/sc-machine/releases). To use these in your CMake project, download and extract the release for your platform to any convenient location. Then make it available to CMake by appending folder path to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`:

```cmake
# import sc-machine from the Releases archive
# you can override this variable via -D<proj_name>_PATH_SC_MACHINE_PATH or CMakeUserPreset.json / CMakePreset.json files
set(<proj_name>_SC_MACHINE_PATH "/location/to/sc-machine-<version>-<platform>" CACHE PATH "sc-machine installation path")

# can be overriden using env variables as well
if(DEFINED ENV{<proj_name>_SC_MACHINE_PATH})
  set(<proj_name>_SC_MACHINE_PATH "$ENV{<proj_name>_SC_MACHINE_PATH}")
endif()

list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH ${<proj_name>_SC_MACHINE_PATH})
```

After making sc-machine available to find_package() in any of the above ways, use this to import our targets:

```cmake
find_package(sc-machine REQUIRED)
```

After adding this code to your build system, using sc-machine libraries and executables will be available to you. Linking to a library will automatically make headers available to you as well.

Let's try to use it!

```cmake
add_executable(wave-find-path main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(wave-find-path sc-machine::sc-memory)
```

```cpp
#include "sc-memory/sc_addr.hpp"

ScAddr graph, rrel_arcs, rrel_nodes;
```

If your IDE doesn't integrate well with this solution, try exporting compile commands in CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Cross-Compilation

For cross-compilation, use the appropriate CMake toolchain file.

### Editing sc-machine while consuming it as a library

It's almost always problematic to edit a project while also consuming it as a library from another project. Luckily, if you've installed sc-machine in your project using Conan, there is a relatively easy solution to that problem.

```sh
conan editable add <path to sc-machine repo>
conan editable list
# sc-machine of the corersponding version should be in the output
# make changes in the project and run a rebuild
cmake --preset debug-conan
# using a debug build since that would allow us to step into the library's code while debugging
cmake --build --preset debug
```

The same is true for installations that have used GitHub Releases artifacts. Download the sc-machine repo, configure it, run `cmake --build --preset <preset> --target install` and add `sc-machine/build/<Debug|Release>/install` to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` of your project. Re-running `cmake --build --preset <preset> --target install` is enough to propagate changes to the consumer.

Relaunch the compilation steps in your project and you should be good to go!

You can find more info in [Conan docs](https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/developing_packages/editable_packages.html).

### Falling Back to System Dependencies

If Conan is not used, the build system will attempt to find system-installed dependencies. Ensure that the necessary development packages are installed on your system.

Currently, we require the following packages to be available to CMake at build-time:

- `glib2`
- `websocketpp`
  - [`asio`](https://think-async.com/Asio/) as the transitive dependency
- `nlohmann_json`

You can use convenience scripts provided in our repo (`scripts/install_deps_ubuntu.sh` and `scripts/install_deps_macOS.sh`) to install these dependencies.

### Testing Conan package definition

It is possible to write tests for the Conan packaging using [local package development flow](https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial/developing_packages/local_package_development_flow.html).
## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with Conan, try clearing the Conan cache: `conan cache clean`
- For CMake configuration issues, check the CMakeCache.txt file in your build directory
- Ensure that your CMake version is compatible with the project requirements
